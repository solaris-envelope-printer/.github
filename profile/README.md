<h1>Envelope Printer - Overview</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the program</h2>
<p><strong>Envelope Printer</strong> is a small Windows application created to simplify the task of preparing mailing envelopes by allowing users to type in sender and recipient information and print directly on blank envelopes. The program eliminates the need to hand-write addresses or manually design envelope templates, replacing it with a straightforward software workflow. According to its description, Envelope Printer was designed to let users enter delivery and return addresses, choose envelope size from predefined templates, and send the job to a printer with minimal effort.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Address entry and printing</strong> - type in recipient (delivery) and return (sender) addresses, select envelope size and print directly on blank envelopes.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for standard envelope sizes</strong> - the tool supports common envelope types, enabling correct formatting and alignment for printing.</li>
  <li><strong>Address book / contact management</strong> - the program can store saved addresses for reuse, making repeated mailing tasks faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional logo or image insertion</strong> - some envelope‑printing tools (including offerings under similar names) support adding a small image or logo to the return address block, which can be useful for business mail.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight and simple</strong> - small download size (a few MB), minimal system requirements, and easy user interface designed for quick envelope printing tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>What distinguishes Envelope Printer from using general-purpose word processors or manual addressing is its simplicity and speed: the program is optimized specifically for envelope printing - no need to layout pages, adjust margins manually, or deal with letter‑sized documents. Instead, users work in a dedicated interface tailored to envelopes, addresses, and printer-ready output. The built-in address book and template support further streamline periodic mailing tasks.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Envelope Printer is suited for individuals or small businesses that send occasional letters, bills, invitations, or mail - especially those who prefer a quick and easy way to address envelopes without relying on mailing services or label stickers. It is also useful for users without large office suites who need a dedicated, lightweight tool for mail correspondence.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Using Envelope Printer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Saves time compared to handwriting addresses or manually formatting envelopes in word processors.</li>
  <li>Convenient address book support - reuse addresses easily without retyping them each time.</li>
  <li>Free to use (freeware) and portable versions available - minimal resource usage and no complex setup.</li>
  <li>Supports common envelope sizes and typical home/office printers - no need for specialized printing hardware.</li>
  <li>Optional image/logo support - useful for professional or branded mailings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Modules & Workflow</h2>
<p>When you launch Envelope Printer, you can either create a new envelope or select a previously saved contact from the address book. Then you fill in the sender and recipient information, optionally attach a logo or image (if supported), select the envelope size template, and preview the envelope layout. After ensuring correct alignment, you insert a blank envelope into your printer's feed tray and click "Print." For recurring recipients, you can save the address in the built‑in address book for future use.</p>

<h2>System Requirements & Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Envelope Printer runs on Windows - compatible with versions from Windows XP up to recent ones (Windows 7, 8, 10 and likely 11).</p>
<p>The application is small (a few megabytes), and does not require powerful hardware or special components - any standard home or office printer capable of handling envelopes is sufficient.</p>

<h2>Licensing and Distribution</h2>
<p>Envelope Printer is distributed as freeware. Both installable and portable versions are available, giving flexibility for users who prefer not to install software permanently or who want to carry the tool between PCs.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Because the tool is basic, it may lack advanced mailing‑list management, bulk‑mail merge, or integration with external CRM or contact databases.</li>
  <li>For large mail‑out operations or complex mailings (e.g. variable data printing, batch jobs, windowed envelopes, specialized postal layouts), more advanced or professional envelope printing solutions may be more suitable.</li>
  <li>User interface and template customization are minimal - advanced layout editing (graphics, complex formatting) may be limited compared with full design software.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Printing a single envelope for a letter, invitation, or personal mail - quickly and neatly without handwriting.</li>
  <li>Small‑scale business mailings: invoices, notices, greeting cards, or correspondence with clients and partners.</li>
  <li>Sending holiday cards, invitations, or personal letters where a clean, computer‑printed address is preferred over handwriting or manual addressing.</li>
  <li>Home office use - occasional mailings by users without access to full office suites or mail‑merge tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation & Setup Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download Envelope Printer from a trusted source (installer or portable ZIP).</li>
  <li>If using installer - run setup and complete installation; for portable version - extract to a folder and run the executable.</li>
  <li>Open the program; add return and destination addresses (manually or by selecting from address book if previously saved).</li>
  <li>Choose envelope size template appropriate for your envelope (e.g. standard #10, DL, C5, etc.).</li>
  <li>Optionally add a logo or custom image for personal or business mailings.</li>
  <li>Select print preview to ensure alignment and correct placement of addresses.</li>
  <li>Insert blank envelope into printer tray (feed according to printer manual) and click Print.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Envelope Printer offers a simple, focused solution for anyone who needs to print addresses directly onto envelopes - without the complexity of general office suites or manual handwriting. Its address book, template support, and optional features such as logos make it a handy tool for personal, home office, and small business mailing tasks. Given its freeware license and lightweight design, Envelope Printer is a practical choice for users seeking an easy envelope printing workflow on Windows.</p>
